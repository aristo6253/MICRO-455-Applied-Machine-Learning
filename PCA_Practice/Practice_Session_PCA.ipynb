    "The document is divided into three parts:\n",

    "* **Part 3-Tasks and Questions:** Set of tasks to be performed during the practical and\n",
    "questions you must answer in your final report. Do not forget to justify your answers for\n",
    "each question. Lack of justification may lead to loss of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this first practical you will focus on loading various real-life datasets, visualizing the\n",
    "data distribution and then selecting good projections of the data through Principal Component\n",
    "Analysis. A good projection is such that it improves the separability of the data or reduces\n",
    "the dimensionality of the dataset, or do both. Throughout the practical session, you will be\n",
    "working on the following real data:\n",
